# alpargun.com

I still own alpargun.com but as I am not currently paying for a hosting service, a copy is hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/alpargun/alpargun.github.io)\
I haven't updated my personal website since 2020 and will update with new projects, work experience, etc. soon.

My personal website: [alpargun.com](http://alpargun.com/) (*not hosted at the moment*)\
A website that resembles the desktop of a computer with draggable icons.
